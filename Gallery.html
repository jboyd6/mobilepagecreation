            <p1> Sayfi Came to me a few months back just before they launched asking me to design their logo for them, this was a big one as they were locla just like Azraa Housing and it meant I would see this logo everywhere. The folks at Sayfi gave me full creative charge and let my mind run off and it has worked out great for all parties involved. They have a logo they are happy with and I got to have full creative charge and really let my imagination run wild.</p1>
